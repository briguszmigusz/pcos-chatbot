# Chicken Cesar Wrap

## Ingredients
- 1 tortilla wrap
- 150 g chicken breast
- 50 g 0% Greek yogurt or skyr
- 50 g mixed salad greens
- 15 g parmesan cheese
- Salt
- Black pepper
- 1 clove garlic
- Lemon juice
- Mustard

## Instructions
1. Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, and half of the grated garlic. Cook in a lightly oiled pan until fully done. Shred or slice.
2. Prepare the dressing: mix yogurt with the remaining garlic, a splash of lemon juice, approximately 1/2 tsp mustard, salt, and pepper.
3. Toss the salad greens in the yogurt dressing.
4. Warm the tortilla in the microwave for 30–60 seconds until soft.
5. Spread the yogurt-coated salad onto the tortilla.
6. Add the chicken and sprinkle parmesan cheese on top.
7. Fold tightly like an envelope and toast both sides briefly in a pan.
8. Serve warm or cold.

## Notes
One serving equals one wrap. Very high-protein, moderate-carbohydrate option suitable for stable blood sugar management. Can be prepared ahead and reheated in a sandwich press.
