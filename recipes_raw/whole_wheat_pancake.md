# Whole Wheat Pancakes (Blender Method)

## Ingredients
- 2 eggs
- 90 g all-purpose flour
- 210 g whole wheat flour
- 10 ml oil
- 200 ml unsweetened almond milk / coconut milk / cow’s milk
- 300–400 ml water (sparkling water optional)
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions
1. Add all ingredients into a blender and blend until completely smooth.
2. Let the batter rest for 15–20 minutes.
3. Heat a pancake pan over medium heat.
4. Lightly oil the pan before the first pancake if needed.
5. Pour a thin layer of batter into the pan and swirl to spread evenly.
6. Cook until lightly golden, flip, and cook the other side.
7. If the batter feels too thick, add a little more water and mix.
8. Repeat until all batter is used (approximately 20–24 pancakes).

## Notes
One serving equals one pancake. Flexible breakfast option that can be combined with high-protein toppings such as Greek yogurt, nut butter, or eggs to support stable blood sugar levels.
