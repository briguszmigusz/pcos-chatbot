# Mini Nutella Donuts (Air Fryer Version)

## Ingredients
- 125 g flour
- 100 g skyr yogurt
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp sweetener
- 40 g Nutella or chocolate spread

## Instructions
1. Mix flour, baking powder, skyr, and sweetener until dough forms.
2. Knead until smooth and workable.
3. Divide dough into 8 equal portions.
4. Flatten each piece and place approximately 5 g chocolate spread in the center.
5. Seal and shape into balls.
6. Lightly spray with oil spray.
7. Bake at 180°C (356°F) in an air fryer for 8 minutes or at 200°C (392°F) in the oven for 10–12 minutes.
8. Turn halfway through baking.
9. Optional: lightly moisten and roll in cinnamon-sweetener mixture after baking.
