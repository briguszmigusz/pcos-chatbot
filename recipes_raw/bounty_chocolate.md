# Homemade Coconut Dark Chocolate Bites (Bounty-Style)

## Ingredients
- 200 ml canned coconut milk
- 150 g shredded coconut
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 15–20 g stevia-erythritol sweetener blend
- 1–2 bars (approximately 100–200 g) 75% dark chocolate

## Instructions
1. In a small saucepan, gently heat the coconut milk with the sweetener and vanilla extract.
2. Once it begins to simmer, add the shredded coconut.
3. Stir and allow the coconut to absorb the liquid until a thick mixture forms.
4. Press the mixture firmly into silicone molds (it will not hold together on its own without pressing).
5. Place in the freezer for 2–3 hours until fully set.
6. Remove from molds.
7. Melt the dark chocolate over a double boiler.
8. Coat each coconut piece in melted chocolate.
9. Sprinkle with a little shredded coconut on top if desired.
10. Store in the refrigerator.

## Notes
One serving equals one coconut bite. Naturally lower in sugar due to stevia-erythritol sweetener and high cocoa dark chocolate. Energy-dense snack best portion-controlled within a 1,500 kcal daily plan.
