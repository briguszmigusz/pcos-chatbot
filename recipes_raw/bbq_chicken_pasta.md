# BBQ Chicken Pasta

## Ingredients
- 500 g chicken breast fillet
- 150 g red onion
- 200 g red bell pepper
- 70 g BBQ sauce
- 50 g tomato paste
- 50 g light cheese
- 200 g pasta (whole wheat recommended)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp garlic powder

## Instructions
1. Finely chop the onion and bell pepper. Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.
2. Cook the pasta according to package instructions and reserve approximately 200 ml of the cooking water.
3. In a lightly oiled pan over medium heat, cook the onion, bell pepper, and chicken together for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add the spices and mix well.
5. Stir in tomato paste and BBQ sauce.
6. Add 150–200 ml of reserved pasta water to create a saucy consistency.
7. Mix in the cooked pasta and simmer for a few more minutes.
8. Stir in grated cheese or sprinkle on top before serving.
9. Divide into 4 equal servings.

## Notes
One serving equals one-quarter of the full recipe. High-protein, meal-prep-friendly option that stores in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Whole wheat pasta recommended for higher fiber and improved blood sugar stability.
