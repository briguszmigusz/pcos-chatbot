# Whole Wheat Hamburger Buns

## Ingredients
- 300 g whole wheat flour
- 150 g all-purpose flour
- 50 g wheat gluten
- 320 g unsweetened almond milk
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 tsp sweetener (optional)
- 50 g oil or butter
- 10 g salt
- 1 packet instant yeast
- 1 tsp sugar (for activating yeast)
- 1 egg (for brushing)

## Instructions
1. Activate the yeast in lukewarm sweetened almond milk.
2. Combine the flours, wheat gluten, salt, oil or butter, egg yolks, and optional sweetener.
3. Add the activated yeast mixture and knead into a smooth, elastic dough.
4. Let rise until doubled in size.
5. Divide into 10 equal pieces and shape into buns.
6. Let rise again for about 30 minutes.
7. Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with seeds if desired.
8. Bake in a preheated oven at 160°C (320°F) with fan setting for 15–18 minutes until golden brown.

## Notes
One serving equals one bun. Higher fiber than traditional white buns due to whole wheat flour and added wheat gluten for protein structure. Ideal as a base for balanced burgers with lean protein and vegetables.
