# One-Pan Creamy Chicken Broccoli Pasta

## Ingredients
- 500 g chicken breast
- 1 onion (approximately 100 g)
- 2–4 cloves garlic
- 400 g broccoli (fresh or frozen)
- 10 g flour
- 200 g pasta
- 200 ml 10% cream
- 80 g light mozzarella
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp salt
- Black pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces. Season with salt, pepper, and oregano. Cook in a lightly oiled pan over medium-high heat until done. Set aside.
2. Finely chop onion and crush garlic. In the same pan, sauté until translucent.
3. Add approximately 100 ml water and sprinkle in flour. Stir until thickened.
4. Add 400 ml water, cream, and stock cube. Bring to a boil.
5. Add pasta and cook covered for 10–12 minutes, stirring halfway.
6. Add broccoli (raw during cooking or preheated if frozen).
7. When pasta is nearly tender, return chicken to the pan.
8. Stir in mozzarella and simmer for 2–3 minutes until creamy.
9. Divide into 4 equal servings.

## Notes
One serving equals one-quarter of the full pan. Balanced high-protein dinner suitable for meal prep. Stores in the refrigerator for 3–4 days.
