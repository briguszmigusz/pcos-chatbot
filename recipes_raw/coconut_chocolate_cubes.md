# High-Protein Coconut Chocolate Cubes

## Ingredients
- 55 g oat flour (or ground oats)
- 40 g vanilla protein powder
- 1 tsp baking powder
- Pinch of salt
- 120 g skyr yogurt
- 100 ml 1.5% milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 30 g low-fat cocoa powder (for coating)
- 25 g shredded coconut (for coating)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C (356°F).
2. Mix oat flour, protein powder, baking powder, and salt.
3. Add skyr and milk, then mix in vanilla extract until smooth.
4. Pour into a silicone loaf pan without flattening too much.
5. Bake for 20 minutes and allow to cool completely.
6. Mix cocoa powder with sweetener and enough warm water to create a thin glaze.
7. Cut the cake into 12 equal pieces.
8. Dip each piece into the cocoa glaze, then roll in shredded coconut.
9. Store in the refrigerator.

## Notes
One serving equals one cube (1/12 of the batch). Light, portion-controlled snack option with moderate protein and lower calorie density compared to traditional coconut cake.
