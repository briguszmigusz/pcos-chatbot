# BBQ Beef Wrap with Skyr Slaw

## Ingredients
- 100 g ground beef (>10% fat)
- 1 tortilla wrap
- 50 g coleslaw mix (cabbage-based salad mix)
- 30 g skyr
- 5 g sriracha sauce (or ketchup if preferred)
- Juice of 1/4 lemon
- 15 g BBQ sauce
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. Cook the ground beef in a pan over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Once fully cooked, add the BBQ sauce and mix well.
3. In a small bowl, combine the skyr and sriracha sauce.
4. Squeeze lemon juice over the coleslaw mix and toss.
5. Warm the tortilla in the microwave for about 30 seconds.
6. Spread the yogurt sauce on the tortilla.
7. Add the BBQ beef, then the coleslaw mixture.
8. Roll tightly and optionally toast both sides briefly in a pan.
9. Serve warm or cold.

## Notes
One serving equals one wrap. Balanced lunch option with high protein and moderate carbohydrates. Suitable for stable blood sugar when paired with high-fiber tortilla and vegetable-rich slaw.
