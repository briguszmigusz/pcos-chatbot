# Zucchini Pork Meatballs

## Ingredients
- 500 g lean ground pork (7% fat)
- 2 medium zucchini (approximately 650–700 g)
- 1 egg
- 1 small onion or 1 tsp onion granules
- 2–3 cloves garlic
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Fresh parsley
- Paprika (sweet or smoked)

## Instructions
1. Grate the zucchini using the large holes of a grater and sprinkle with salt.
2. Let it sit for 30 minutes to release excess moisture.
3. Using a clean kitchen towel, squeeze out as much liquid as possible.
4. In a large bowl, combine the drained zucchini with the ground pork, egg, onion, garlic, and seasonings.
5. Mix until well combined.
6. Form small meatballs (approximately 25–30 mini pieces).
7. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
8. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) with fan/convection setting for about 30 minutes, turning halfway through.
9. Optional: Roll the meatballs in breadcrumbs before baking if desired.

## Notes
High-protein, moderate-fat dinner option suitable for insulin resistance. Can be served with bulgur and cucumber salad with sour cream, or paired with a lighter vegetable side for a lower-calorie meal.
