# Oven-Baked Breaded Chicken Breast

## Ingredients
- 500 g chicken breast fillet
- 2 eggs
- 75 g breadcrumbs
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Garlic powder
- Optional dried herbs
- Oil spray

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200°C (392°F).
2. Slice chicken breast thinly and tenderize.
3. Season both sides with salt, pepper, and preferred spices.
4. Beat eggs in a bowl.
5. Prepare breadcrumbs (optional: mix with sesame seeds or herbs).
6. Dip chicken into egg, then coat in breadcrumbs.
7. Place on a lined baking tray and spray lightly with oil spray.
8. Bake 15 minutes, flip, then bake another 15 minutes until golden.
9. Divide into 4 equal servings.

## Notes
One serving equals approximately one-quarter of the recipe. Leaner alternative to deep-fried breaded chicken. Pairs well with potatoes or salad for a balanced meal.
