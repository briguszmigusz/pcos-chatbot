## Ingredients
- 500 g cauliflower, chopped
- 500 g carrots, sliced
- 2 parsley roots, chopped
- 250 g frozen green peas
- 3 small potatoes (approximately 200 g), diced
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2–3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 tbsp sweet paprika powder
- 1 tbsp flour
- Salt and black pepper
- Fresh parsley leaves, chopped

## Instructions
1. Heat the oil in a large pot and sauté the chopped onion until translucent.
2. Add the carrots and parsley root, sauté for a few minutes.
3. Stir in the paprika powder and flour, cook briefly while stirring.
4. Pour in approximately 1.5 liters of water or vegetable stock.
5. Season with salt and pepper, then add garlic and cauliflower.
6. When vegetables are halfway tender, add peas and potatoes.

One serving equals one-sixth of the full pot. High-fiber, vegetable-rich meal that supports steady blood sugar levels. Can be paired with a protein source (e.g., Greek yogurt or lean meat) to increase protein content if needed.
