# Chocolate Zucchini Loaf Cake

## Ingredients
- 300 g grated zucchini
- 2 eggs
- 60 g coconut oil
- 25 g high-intensity sweetener
- 30 g Dutch cocoa powder
- 130 g whole wheat or oat flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- Large pinch of salt
- 75 g dark chocolate (70%+)

## Instructions
1. Grate zucchini using fine holes. Lightly squeeze out excess moisture if needed.
2. Mix zucchini with eggs, melted coconut oil, and sweetener.
3. Sift in flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. Stir until combined.
5. Fold in chopped dark chocolate.
6. Pour into a parchment-lined 20x10 cm loaf pan.
7. Bake at 170°C (338°F) with fan for 35–40 minutes.
8. Allow to cool before slicing into 10 pieces.

## Notes
One serving equals one slice (1/10 of loaf). Higher-fat dessert option due to coconut oil and chocolate. Stores well for several days.
